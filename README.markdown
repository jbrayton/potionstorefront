PotionStorefront
--------------------------

This is my fork of [Potion Storefront](https://github.com/potionfactory/potionstorefront), a great way to allow customers to purchase your app right from within the app.

I made a bunch of customizations that may not be useful to other developers, but feel free to take what you want.  Perhaps most importantly, I am not using the Potion Store; I have my own script that processes the purchase via Stripe.  I think most of my changes could be applied to any store -- although this fork has a link directly to my web-based store that other developers probably do not want.

Thanks to the [Potion Storefront](https://github.com/potionfactory/potionstorefront) project for this great framework.
